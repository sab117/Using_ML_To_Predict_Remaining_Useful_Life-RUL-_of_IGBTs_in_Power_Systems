This is my 4th year project. Order of going through the folder is as follows:

1. Data Serialisation
2. Cleaning Data
3. Visualisation of RAW data
4. Linear Regression for Average Ic
5. Clustering Model for Ic
6. Remianing Useful Life RUL

Most Folders have README_X files where X denotes a number. The number goes up this corrsponds to the major markers of the project.
Some sub folders are numbered. Start from the smallest then up sequentially to the biggest. This indicates what file was made first and what order the project took place
