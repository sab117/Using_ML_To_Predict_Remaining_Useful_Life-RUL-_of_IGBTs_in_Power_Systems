# Using_ML_To_Predict_Remaining_Useful_Life-RUL-_of_IGBTs_in_Power_Systems
Code is final 4th year project showing how machine learning can be used to predict the remaining useful life of IGBTs within power systems applications.

The IGBT used in this ML model is the IGBT IRF-G4BC30KD

The construction of this IGBTs contains bondwires which is similar to that would be found in industrial IGBTs that utilise bondwires.
Unless they are preassure plate IGBTs as these IGBTs.
