"Graphs folder" --> Contains all the visual outputs for each linear regression model. The following terms are as follows:

-Ic-->Collector Current
-Ig-->Gate Current
-Rc-->Collector Resistance
-Vc-->Collector Voltage


"Sets 1-4" Contain the code using linear regression to obtain the average values for Ic,Ig,Rc and Vc

Ic & Vc are the most promising results. Ultimately Ic data was used later on as paper detailed more thourghly that Ic data does show signs of failure. Hence why main folder 
is called "Linear Regression for Average Ic"
